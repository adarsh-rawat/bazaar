This Project is separated into 3 repos. This repo is the top level repo that houses the frontend module for Admin (Seller) View.
It is built with React Native to provide cross platform support. (Web, Android)
Overall, the project is very similar to shopify's architecture.

The other two repos are:
1. [Bazaar-Backend](https://github.com/DipanshuJ/bazaar-backend): houses the backend for Admin View.
2. [Bazaar- Web](https://github.com/Mit2561/Bazzar-web): consists of both fronted+backend for public view (or customer's view).
